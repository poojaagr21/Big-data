Harbar Ray, Garbar Singh, Chhuchhika, Puchinga, Haro
Khan with all his bag and baggage, Bachha Korar Khan, Gunju
Khan Hazari, made the Tuslika into Pathans. They harrassed
Ramprasad Babu and put Nitai Singh Daraga into prison. 
Chingu Babu hid himself. Being harrassed, like a rosagalla
leaving his house, went to see the temples of gods said to be at 
Burdwan.

Than Singh, Chhuchikka, Puchinga, Haro Khan with all 
his bag and baggage, Bachha Korar Khan, Gunju Khan Hazari,
made the Tuslika into Pathans.

They did not care for the Babus of the Maghs (corrupt)
They are taking ras in pots, walking on the sandy roads. Being
harrassed, Chingubabu hid himself. A Yogi quickly came 
there.

This is the train to Puri -- so many hens' eggs, hundreds 
of goyats, one, two, three reports were sent to Hooghly, Midnapore,
Calcutta.

Ramprasad Babu was harrassed by them. The leader of 
the eighteen kahans of decoits was caught, and beating the
drums, he was hung in Midnapore Phansighat.

I eat and live and sing of these men. May he be hung who
robs the Babus this way. I eat and live singing their names.

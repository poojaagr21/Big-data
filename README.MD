USed an nltk package to figure out whether the word is an English word or not. 

ABOUT THE FILES:
Input files:  Emancipated.txt, EngrejerPat.txt
Code file : Map_Reduce_combiner_code.docx (This file contains the psuedo code for all the six steps with input and output at each step to achieve the output)
Output files: Song 1.docx, Song 2.docx contains the output execution of Emancipated and engrejerPat file . it shows the output of each step for that particular song.

Result: After completing this project i got an higher level understanding of distributed computing, map reduce , combiners, and the advantage of parallel computing.
